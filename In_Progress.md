No title yet, 4/2/19, Adobe Illustrator file that I will embroider on clear vinyl, 18" x 24"
This image is a collection of data sets from GANs using auto-encoding. This type of GAN mimics hand-drawn data sets, but due to mode collapse, some of the resulting data sets look less like numbers and more like strange, abstracted glyphs. I'm embroidering these onto clear vinyl and I'll be adding other layers of clear vinyl to my finished work with more embroidery/painting.
