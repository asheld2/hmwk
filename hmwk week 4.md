1) The most interesting technology I discovered was dueling neural networks. In the past, AI was only capable of analyzing and interpreting images, i.e. being able to find a picture of a red car out of thousands of pictures of red objects. It wasn't possible until recently for AI to have "imagination" (or the closest thing we can get to it.) For a robot to create an image rather than just analyze one, two neural networks have to be set up - these are called the generator and discriminator. The generator randomly produces pixels in an image, and the discriminator will determine if this picture actually looks like something. Eventually, the generator and discriminator communicate and learn off of each other to the point that the generator can create convincing (but fake) images - such as an image of a red car that doesn't actually exist.
2) EMV chip cards started being used around 2015. These store payment data in circuits on a small chip, in addition to the usual magnetic stripe found on credit cards. The chip generates a unique code for each transaction, making transactions with a chip card much more secure than transactions with a stripe card, which give away your credit card number for each payment.
3) Mass-market VR started to become popular around 2014-2015. VR existed decades before this, but was extremely expensive and not widely available. Newer VR also comes with motion sensing technology that detects the movement of your head to provide life-like imagery. Some of the first versions of mass market VR headsets wasn't the PlayStation VR, created by Sony.
4) Real-time language translation can now be accomplished with a set of earbuds. They use voice recognition as well as AI, and will translate conversations as they happen.
5) Augmented reality is now commonly used in apps like Snapchat, or, several years ago, Pok√©mon Go. These technologies enhance real-life images through AI and added graphics. I still don't really understand how they work.
