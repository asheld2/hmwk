One of the most popular early BBSs is called Fido - this was developed by Tom
Jennings in 1984, as a type of network which uses the Microsoft operating system.
It was also a comparatively low-cost BBS and gained a lot of popularity in the
early 1990s. Other BBSs are LatinoNet, a Spanish BBS that started in Argentina
and Puerto Rico, and the BatBoard, a BBS for Batman fans. Source: https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/cyberspace/social-medias-dialup-ancestor-the-bulletin-board-system
The majority of people who helped save GeoCities were amateur archivists, who
through a combined effort saved an estimated 1 million web pages by downloading
them to hard drives. Internet Archive also participated in the preservation of
GeoCities.
